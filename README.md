# TIC_TAC_TOE_Ghost

Implementation of the classic TIC TAC TOE with a twist, called Ghost Mode where the players have to remember their selection as well as opponent's selection of tile
since the selection disappers after 1 second.

This makes the game a bit hard as you need to memorize the selection as well as play optimally.

Two player modes as well as Artificial Intelligence mode is incorporated which is an UNBEATABLE Computer implemented using Mini MAX ALGORITHM.

Version 2.0 of this project with further 5x5 tiles and other modes are in development.
